# How to manage multiple identities in Git
What I've learnt. 

## How to write a <pattern>
Add a conditional section [includeIf <condition>] after [user]

        [includeIf "gitdir:<pattern>"]
	        path = .gitconfig-flossan

Example 1: 

        [includeIf "gitdir:github/"]
	        path = .gitconfig-flossan

- If the pattern starts with ~/, ~ stands for $HOME which is C:\Users\<User> under Windows. 

- If the pattern starts without a path indicator, not even a /, which is the case of my example above, it means that this rule applys for any path that contains the <pattern>.

- If the pattern ends with a /, then everything inside the <pattern> will also match. 

Other good examples:

        [includeIf "gitdir:~/github"]

        [includeIf "gitdir:d:/github/"]

- Git is case sensitive. A "gitdir:github" <pattern> will not match up with "d:/Github/" folder. 

    - This doens't change even if you set core.ignorecase = true. 

- But disk letter doesn't matter. You can write either D:/ or d:/. 


## config
Create a file named .gitconfig-<name> in $HOME. 

In it there should be: 

        [core]
            sshCommand = ssh -i <id_rsa_path>
        [user]
            name = <name>
            email = <email>

Normally <id_rsa> stays in ~/.ssh/
